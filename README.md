Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems

Works in this repository are my own.

Do not use my work to complete the excercises.

Do **RTFM**, _try_, _try harder_, **RTFM**, _re-try_... __then you are done__.

I just needed a place to save my work, branch it, test it and so on.

Remember you _signed_ the "Honor of code".

**Be passionate, be ethic, be you**.
